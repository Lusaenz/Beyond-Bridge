## Game Flow
The player starts at a predetermined point on the map, where they can observe their surroundings. Wherever the player goes, Mango will follow. As they move, the camera tracks them, ensuring they are fully aware of the various obstacles. When they reach a cliff, both must press a button to activate a bridge, allowing them to cross to the other side. However, triggering the button also stirs the volcano, forcing the player to proceed with caution if they hope to make it across safely.
